## Native helper experiment

On 2026-09-26, code commit `f60e77f` was checked on macOS 27 / Apple M5 with MoltenVK. A copied save loaded through character selection into the village, followed by a short walking route. The scale-matrix verifier compared 48,365 live calls with no mismatch; a separate native run executed 48,405 calls without fallback. Captures were visually inspected. Both replacements remain opt-in.

This result covers that route and helper only. The angle-step helper was not called on the route. Audio output was disabled, and combat, quests, multiplayer, other platforms and long sessions were not checked. See [the experiment guide](NATIVE_EXPERIMENT.md#recorded-local-result) for isolated differential tests and limits.

## Paired testing tools

The paired-test tooling at commit `4759d99` passed offline delivery checks on
Apple Silicon macOS 27.0 on 2026-09-27: both signed applications completed native
launcher preparation-only runs with independent equal starting saves. No full
game was launched. This does not change any gameplay compatibility cell above;
live coverage, dialog appearance and user acceptance remain pending. See
[paired test applications](PAIRED_TEST_APPLICATIONS.md#recorded-offline-delivery-check)
for the evidence scope.

The formal first-case pack at commit `75ca5ff` subsequently passed its offline
catalog/panel/journal tests and signed-app preparation-only readiness gate on
the same platform. That delivery check made the four user cases ready without
establishing CASE-001 gameplay acceptance. See [the first handoff](TEST_CASES.md#recorded-first-handoff).

The user subsequently completed both `75ca5ff` observation builds on
2026-09-27. All four cases were marked normal in both roles and the recordings
were complete. Candidate scale and matrix-copy helpers passed 511,126 and
9,772 same-input verifications inside the marked cases, respectively. Three
other helpers remained untriggered. Manual input differences and temporary
paused-menu rendering-scale changes prevent an unconditional paired-route
pass; no confirmed native-helper mismatch was recorded. No combat, quests,
multiplayer or long-session result is added by this route. See
[the scoped first acceptance report](FIRST_PAIRED_ACCEPTANCE.md).

## Updating this page

Run through [the smoke test](TESTING.md) on the platform, then change the cells you checked in the same pull request as the fix, or in a pull request of their own. Add a row to *Tested hardware* with the commit you tested. A result without a commit cannot be compared with anything later, so it does not go in the table.

To report a result without editing the page, open a **Test report** issue.
